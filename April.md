# April, 2018. First grant month

We will set as the official beginning of the grant April 1st, 2018,
which was a Sunday. 

Let's list the contributions made during the month of April.

## Issues closed

Using the Perl 6 scripts included in this repo, I have closed 27
issues during April:

![Issues closed by me and others](illos/closed-issues-jj.png).

This number of issues has been extracted using the GitHub API and is
probably underestimating the real number, sincd more than 100 issues
have been closed in the last month. Anyway, as far as it's
underestimating everyone's closed issues in the same way, it shows
that most closed issues have been closed by me.
