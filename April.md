# April, 2018. First grant month

We will set as the official beginning of the grant April 1st, 2018,
which was a Sunday. 

Let's list the contributions made during the month of April.

## Issues closed

Using the Perl 6 scripts included in this repo, I have closed 27
issues during April:

![Issues closed by me and others](illos/closed-issues-jj.png).

The initial compromise was to *address* two issues every day; I have
been checking and commenting on issues far more than that, tagging
them with `JJ TPF grant`. In fact, as it can be seen, I closed two
issues per day, twice as much as the rest of the issues that were
closed.
