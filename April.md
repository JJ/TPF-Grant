# April, 2018. First grant month

We will set as the official beginning of the grant April 1st, 2018,
which was a Sunday. 

Let's list the contributions made during the month of April.

## Issues closed

Using the Perl 6 scripts included in this repo, I have closed 27
issues during April:

![Issues closed by me and others](illos/closed-issues-jj.png).

The initial compromise was to *address* two issues every day; I have
been checking and commenting on issues far more than that, tagging
them with `JJ TPF grant`. In fact, as it can be seen, I closed two
issues per day, twice as much as the rest of the issues that were
closed.

In fact, those issues are, on average, 4 months old, or almost 120
days, while the average for the rest of the contributors is ~1
month. That means that many of the issues addressed were part of the
backlog that was accumulationg, and weren't, in fact, being addressed,
making the number of issues accumulate to the tune of a few tens every
month.
