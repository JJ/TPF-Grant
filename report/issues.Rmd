title: 'Perl 6 documentation repository through time: An initial report'
author: "JJ Merelo"
date: "26 de abril de 2018"
output: html_document
bibliography: perl6.bib
abstract: After getting a grant from the Perl Foundation for taking care of the repository where Perl 6 documents are hosted, I wanted to run an initial assessment of how this documentation is behaving in terms of community and evolution. One of the compromises I committed to was to engage with at least 2 issues a day, since the number of issues was initially around 300 and was increasing. So in this initial report I will take a look at these issues, who posts them, who solves them, how long does it take to close them.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

issues <- read.csv("../data/issues.csv")
opens.gt.1 <- issues[issues$created_by %in%  names( table(issues$created_by)[table(issues$created_by) > 1]),]
closes.gt.1 <- issues[issues$closer %in%  names( table(issues$closer)[table(issues$closer) > 1]),]
closes.gt.1 <- closes.gt.1[closes.gt.1$state == " closed",]
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
