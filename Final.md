# Final report 

Here's the final report, referring to the set
of
[objectives stated](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2018/02/grant-proposal-curating-and-im.html) in
the original proposal.

## Working on all outstanding issues and address all of the issues in 2015, 2016 and 2017

Well, this was kind of ambitious. There are now 25 issues which were
opened in 2015 and 2016, but most of them are marked either
`wishlist`, `external` or `NOT-SPECCED`.

These are the issues closed per creation year, during and before the
grant.

| Year | Issues |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2015 | 9      |
| 2016 | 65     | 
| 2017 | 65     |
| 2018 | 179    |
