# Final report 

Here's the final report, referring to the set
of
[objectives stated](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2018/02/grant-proposal-curating-and-im.html) in
the original proposal.

## Working on all outstanding issues and address all of the issues in 2015, 2016 and 2017

Well, this was kind of ambitious. There are now 25 issues which were
opened in 2015 and 2016, but most of them are marked either
`wishlist`, `external` or `NOT-SPECCED`.

These are the issues closed per creation year, during and before the
grant.

| Year | Issues |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2015 | 9      |
| 2016 | 65     | 
| 2017 | 65     |
| 2018 | 179    |

I have checked out all issues in 2015 and 2016, and most issues in
2017, labeling them, in some cases commenting. However, there's a lot
of work to be done, mostly in `big` issues such
as
[this one on exceptions](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/516). I
have, however, happily contributed to
closing [the *roadmap* issue](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/114)
by creating all remaining pages.

> More needed pages appeared after closing that one, but they are in
> other issues and are left for future work.


# Creating a set of rules for existing and new contributions and enforce those rules in the test suite

[Issue](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md) and
[pull request templates](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) have
been added to the
site. The
[style guides](https://github.com/perl6/doc/tree/master/writing-docs),
have been updated several times, and now include
a
[Squashathon Howto](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/writing-docs/SQUASHATHONS.md).

Several tests have been
added:
[testing fake links](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/xt/links-not-links.t),
[normalizes some words](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/xt/word-variants.t). [Tests
have been ordered and reorganized](https://github.com/perl6/doc/tree/master/t).

In general, this objective has been pretty much achieved, but there's
still a lot of work to do.
