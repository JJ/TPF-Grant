  "body": "For example, in the 'Adverb' section, the link at the bottom to 'Colon Pair and Colon List' doesn't work. It changes the url in the browser, but doesn't move you on the page. However, the ToC links do work. The one difference I can see is that the ToC links have an '_' on the end of the link (e.g., the url it has is 'https://docs.perl6.org/language/glossary#Colon_Pair_and_Colon_List_' instead of 'https://docs.perl6.org/language/glossary#Colon_Pair_and_Colon_List').\n\nHowever, some links do seem to work, but I can't find a reason why the difference. E.g., in the 'Apocalypse' section, the 'TimToady' link works but the 'Exegesis' and 'Synopsis' links don't.\n",
