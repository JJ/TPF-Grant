  "body": "Firstly, if you change UInt to just \"Int\" - nothing will change.\r\n* What should `++` mean here? Does it do something else with UInt?\r\n* What do we want to show with `my Int $i = $u`?\r\n* `say $u.WHAT` and `a subset of Int is an Int` - oh, really? And it makes reader to think that `.WHAT` will show you a subset of type. But it is the opposite on a different line!\r\n\r\nThe simple\r\n```\r\nmy UInt $a = 5;  # okay\r\nmy UInt $a = -5; # Exception about failed type check\r\nmy UInt $b = 0;\r\n--$b; # Exception once again\r\nsay $a.WHAT; # It is still (Int)\r\n```\r\nwill be much more approachable and correct.",
