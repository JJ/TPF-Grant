  "body": "Ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall#Notes_on_Memory_management\r\n\r\nThe example under \"Notes on Memory management\" has some problems:\r\n\r\n1.  A Perl6 runtime error occurs because the init() method is declared with only named args but called with positionals.\r\n\r\n2.  The code (with above problem fixed) segfaults or corrupts memory because of a buffer-overflow: No storage is allocated in the $!a_string member which C code writes into.\r\n\r\nThe C code does `strcpy(target->a_string, str);` where `target->a_string` is a (char *) pointer in the `$.a_string` field/attribute of the CStruct in Perl6 code.\r\n\r\nHowever this attribute is only ever bound with \r\n  ` $!a_string := Str.new;`\r\nbut no space is allocated for a non-zero-length string.\r\n\r\nI'll try to attach a shell script which demos the problem.\r\n[demo.sh.txt](https://github.com/perl6/doc/files/1718082/demo.sh.txt)\r\n\r\n",
