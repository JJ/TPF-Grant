  "body": "I am inclined to create this ticket because:\r\n* There was a ticket asking to provide texas versions of code snippets: #526\r\n* “The community as a whole is pushing unicode; I think the docs should lead in this effort, and it's OK to be unicode only, because […]”[⁽¹⁾](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/526#issuecomment-320820473)\r\n* Replacing non-texas ops will be relatively easy should we decide to move in another direction (much easier than doing the opposite)\r\n* Automatically replacing non-texas ops *on the fly* will be possible if we decide to reopen #526 (other way around is nearly impossible)\r\n* Copy-pasting code snippets from docs into ``perl6 -e '…'`` is easy for users if non-ascii quotes are used consistently\r\n* Currently our docs are using ``\"…\"`` type of quotes too much (possibly contributors are preferring ``\"…\"`` instead of ``'…'`` so that things can be copy-pasted into ``perl6 -e '…'``, but I'd much rather see single quotes used consistently when no interpolation is needed)\r\n* The transition is relatively easy given that we don't have to force contributors to use non-ascii stuff. We can simply have some ``xxt/`` tests and someone who can type non-ascii stuff easily will rework a bunch of new code snippets once a few months.\r\n\r\nIt may sound radical but I guess that's technically the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] Document this style decision\r\n- [ ] Rework the majority of code samples, perhaps in a semi-automated way (over 50% is enough)\r\n- [ ] Help with https://github.com/vim-perl/vim-perl6/issues/8 https://github.com/perl6/atom-language-perl6/issues/72 https://github.com/perl6/perl6-mode/issues/14\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/drforr/perl6-Perl6-Tidy/issues/3 ?\r\n- [ ] Add some ``xt`` or ``xxt`` tests?",
