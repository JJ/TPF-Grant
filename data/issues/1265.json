  "body": "These two sentences documenting Array.clone uses a form of \"reify\" several times. Various discussions outside of the docs throw it around freely.\r\n\r\n> However, note that the reifier is shared between the two Arrays, so both Arrays will have the same elements even when each is randomly-generated on reification and each element will be reified just once, regardless of whether the reification was done by the clone or the original Array. Note: just as reifying an Array from multiple threads is not safe, so is, for example, reifying the clone from one thread while reifying the original from another thread is not safe.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the term is only used twice anywhere else in the docs. Once in [control.pod6](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/control.pod6) and once in [traps.pod6](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/traps.pod6). It does not show up where it matters: [Seq](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Seq) and [Range](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Range).\r\n\r\nThere's a definition in [S99](http://design.perl6.org/S99.html#reification), but it's a bit of a tarbaby for the beginner programmer who doesn't know the additional formal terms presented in that definition.",
