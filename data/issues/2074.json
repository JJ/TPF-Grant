  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe [Iterable role page](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Iterable) shows a very straighforward example, however it's not so clear that what's showing is what's actually happening. Some complexity is hidden under the fact that we are declaring `@a` and not the natural thing, `$a`. If we do so, it will say: `Cannot assign to an immutable value`\r\n\r\nIn general this example causes some confusion, like [this question in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50580476/when-does-for-call-the-iterator-method). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nChange the example so that it's using directly Iterable, and calling `for` directly from that.\r\n",
