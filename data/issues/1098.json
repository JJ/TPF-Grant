  "body": "At some point (hopefully soon), the Unicode superscript exponent operator should be documented together with the '**' operator on the \"operators\" page (source: [doc/Language/operators.pod6](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/operators.pod6)) under \"[Exponentiation Precedence](https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#Exponentiation_Precedence)\".  The two operators are fairly identical in theory, but there is an open [RT #130414](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130414) on differences in associativity.  As noted on the ticket, roast tests have been added and so identical behavior is part of the current spec.  User facing documentation is intended to reflect working features and it may be appropriate to hold off on documentation until the ticket is resolved (but not sure).\r\n\r\n",
