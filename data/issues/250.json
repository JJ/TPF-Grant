  "body": "This PR extends the travis configuration to also run make html.\nI didn't commit this directly because it extends the travis build time from 11 min to **40 min**.\n\nThe Pro's are that issues such as  #227 and #240 and #241 will be immediately noticed when they arise.\nThe Con's are that this duplicates some info captured in the build logs http://doc.perl6.org/build-log/?C=M;O=D  and slows down the CI system substantially\n",
