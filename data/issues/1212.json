This encourages me to make edits.\r\n\r\nIn an old closed issue the last two comments were Moritz's [\"it would be more useful to link to the non-raw pages on github\"](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/53#issuecomment-76188572) and Paul's agreement: \"To be honest, I think so too.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of problems of course. Paul mentions one. Other factors to consider include that it might be considered better to push folk to read the contributing doc before they do a PR.\r\n\r\nBased on my current understanding that this is an easy-to-apply change, I agree with Moritz and Paul that, all things considered:\r\n\r\n> it would be more useful to link to the non-raw pages on github",
