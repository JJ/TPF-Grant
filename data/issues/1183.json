  "body": "Example Problem: `comb` in the Cool type and the Str type has different information\r\n\r\nExample Solution: Provide the info on `comb` in the Cool type. For the Str type, just link to the cool page description and only include details in how the Str method differs from the Cool method\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor a grander solution, perhaps we should start thinking about storing doc entries as data points that are inserted into the html pages, rather than text that is literally written in the page.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `comb` entry might be stored as the json here: http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/?id=424e253ffb53136fb5b0b5a25a68d58a\r\n\r\nAnd then you insert the data by accessing it like \r\n\r\n`types.Cool.methods[\"routine comb\"].explanation`\r\n\r\nJust throwing an idea out there.",
