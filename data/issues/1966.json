That means that more important tests that would surface important errors are only run when it's their alphabetical turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nI would suggest this order\r\n\r\n1. 00-meta.t\r\n2. 01-load.t (maybe these two could be merged, but that's another issue)\r\n3. 02-pod-valid.t\r\n4. 03-pod6.t (maybe merging it into 00 and 01, too)\r\n5. 04-typegraph.t\r\n6. 05-pod-convenience.t\r\n7. 06-pod-htmlify.t\r\n8. 07-tabs.t\r\n\r\n",
