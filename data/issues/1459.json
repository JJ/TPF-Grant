Initializers are also called before object construction time. This can be used to access class attributes in initializers.\r\n\r\nThis is not actually the case. `self` is not a type object there, it is a **partially constructed object** which counts as `.defined`:\r\n\r\n``` Perl 6\r\nclass A {\r\n    submethod BUILD { say self.defined; }\r\n}\r\nA.new;  # True\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed, virtual method calls with the `self.foo` syntax work there.  \r\n(The `$.foo` method call syntax doesn't, [to protect users from writing buggy code](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-08-19#i_15042309).)",
