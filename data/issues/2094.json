  "body": " - It appears that the nodejs package no longer exists for the base image\r\n    used by the Dockerfile, and since it's already using the `n` script to\r\n    install the latest stable version of nodejs, I simply use `n` to\r\n    install nodejs in the first place instead.\r\n\r\n- Also fixed a small code formatting issue in packages.pod6.\r\n\r\n- Corrected the instructions on running the built docker image in CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, I was only trying to fix the formatting issue in packages.pod6, but couldn't get\r\nMojolicious working to be able to preview my changes, so I ended up building a docker\r\nimage from the Dockerfile.\r\n",
