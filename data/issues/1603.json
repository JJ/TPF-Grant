Did you mean to use $_ inside a block?\r\n  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n> why is this? why doesn't this dwim?\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowed by:\r\n> \\<geekosaur\\> \tI thought this was a listed/known trap\r\n\r\nYet I don't see it listed on the traps page. We have a similar item [there](https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps#Topicalizing_Operators)â€¦ similar but completely different. That being said, the trick that is mentioned there still applies:\r\n```perl6\r\nmy @a = <1 2 3>; say @a.grep( 2 ~~ *.Int );\r\n```\r\n```\r\n(2)\r\n```\r\nHowever, more common solution to this is to use a block instead:\r\n```perl6\r\nmy @a = <1 2 3>; say @a.grep( {.Int ~~ 2} );\r\n```\r\n```\r\n(2)\r\n```",
