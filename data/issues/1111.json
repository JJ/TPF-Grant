  "body": "The docs for [open](https://docs.perl6.org/routine/open) say:\r\n\r\n> Defaults to \"Unicode\", which implies figuring out which actual UTF is in use, either from a BOM or other heuristics. If heuristics are inconclusive, UTF-8 will be assumed. (No 8-bit encoding will ever be picked implicitly.) \r\n\r\nThe \"implies\" is a bit weasly, but this seems to say that Perl 6 will actually try to guess the UTF. It might do that, but it seems that it can only read UTF-8. When I try it with UTF-16, I get:\r\n\r\n    Caught X::AdHoc: Streaming decode NYI for encoding 4\r\n\r\nI don't see where that error comes from, but perhaps the docs should say that Perl 6 assumes it's UTF-8 (no guessing).\r\n",
