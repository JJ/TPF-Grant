  "body": "Right now the [tests](https://github.com/perl6/doc/tree/master/t) are not very useful.\n\nIt would be great if there were tests for the documentation content. For example: no space after comma (https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/624), weird indentation (e.g. mixed tabs with spaces), trailing whitespace, etc.\n\nI am pretty sure that there are even better ideas (spell checking, anyone?), but we should start somewhere. Let's add one or two tests, so that it's clear how to write such tests, and the rest will be figured out.\n\nThe problem is that you can't just grep for stuff, the test should parse pod properly. Basically, any clear demonstration on how to do that will solve this issue.\n",
