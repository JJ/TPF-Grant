  "body": "This branch referes to isse #1671 and creates a separate section in order to explain, with a simple example, what backtracking is.\r\nI've also added the term to the glossary, linked from ratchet to the new section.\r\nI've placed the section at the very end of the regexes since I don't believe we should explain \"before\" what backtracking is, it is an internal thing.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds good, I can merge. If need further work, I can proceed.",
