  "body": "https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/redo\r\n\r\nThe code example doesn't run. It fails saying \"Control flow commands not allowed in toplevel\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Perl 6 doesn't consider a bare block to be a loop that runs only once. I couldn't find another kind of block that works like that either.\r\n\r\nLeaving this here in case someone googles for this issue and needs a quick workaround:\r\n\r\n    sub redoable(&b) { my $i; until $i++ { &b() } }\r\n    redoable {\r\n        ...\r\n        redo if ...;\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat wouldn't be a nice solution for the docs, though.",
