Leaving aside the lazy case for this issue (as the syntax is still being discussed), I think it'd make sense to document how to do the build-time default thing with attributes.\n\n...including the nice trick with putting `die` in the rhs to make the object explode at build time if an attribute was not passed in.\n",
