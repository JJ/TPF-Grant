  "body": "In classtut document (e.g. https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut), I believe there is an error in the section re Introspection when describing the \" ^methods\" method.\n\nIn the example output, it shows methods for class Programmer (which seems to be consistent with rest of the example output).  \n\nBut in explanatory text below the example, it refers to (incorrectly I believe) the Employee class, e.g.\n\n> The :local named argument limits the returned methods to those defined in the Employee class \n\nThere is another reference to Employee class in the following paragraph.\n\nI am still transitioning from Perl5 to 6, but I believe the two references to Employee class should actually be Programmer class. \n",
