  "body": "Custom classes can implement `submethod DESTROY` to do some clean-up when/if an object of that class is about to be garbage-collected.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, p6doc currently does not explain this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are some intricacies to document:\r\n\r\n* It is not guaranteed to be run (e.g. it'll never run for objects that aren't garbage collected before the end of the program).\r\n* It is called by the garbage collector, on a thread whose normal control flow is currently paused.\r\n* One mustn't make any assumptions about what the dynamic environment of that thread currently looks like.   <sup>(\"[just about *anything* can be on the call stack at the point a DESTROY is called](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-10-14#i_15301619)\" &mdash; jnthn)</sup>.\r\n* For example...\r\n  * if the thread in question has called `.protect(&code)` on a [`Lock`](http://docs.perl6.org/type/Lock)...  \r\n  * and is in the middle of executing `&code` when it is paused by garbage collection...\r\n  * and your `DESTROY` method calls `.protect(&cleanup)` on the same lock...\r\n\r\n  ...then `&cleanup` will be executed immediately even though `&code` has not yet finished &ndash; because `Lock.protect` is idempotent (i.e. can be recursively locked from the same thread).\r\n* In such cases, one can write a DESTROY method as follows to ensure it is run on a \"clean\" thread that is not in the middle of doing things which may cause surprises for your clean-up code:  \r\n  `submethod DESTROY { start { ... } }`  \r\n  I.e. in the `Lock` example:  \r\n  `submethod DESTROY { start $lock.protect: { ... } }`  \r\n  You can safely close over `self` in the `{ ... }` part, and object destruction will be deferred for as long as necessary <sup>(without calling `DESTROY` a second time &ndash; see jnthn's comment below)</sup>.\r\n  See IRC discussion [starting here](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-10-14#i_15301603).",
