While we're at it, we might want to give uniform names to \"tutorials\", \"guides\", and \"howtos\". There's an IO \"guide\" and a grammars \"tutorial\". There are also Python, Ruby and other \"nutshell\", but a Haskell-to-p6.\r\nUnderscores are only used in 3 files. We might want to change those three names and include indirections in the .htaccess file. Dashes are better than underscores, too.",
