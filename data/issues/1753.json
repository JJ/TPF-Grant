  "body": "From the [docs](https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Identifiers):\r\n\r\n> Identifiers can contain colon pairs. The entire colon pair becomes part of the name of the identifier.\r\n\r\nHere is a nicer example of that:\r\n```perl6\r\nmy $foo:bar<2> = 5;\r\nsay $foo:bar(1+1) # OUTPUT: «5␤»\r\n```\r\n\r\n… but why?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is probably some material for [faq-why](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/114) (“Why things are the way they are in Perl 6”).",
