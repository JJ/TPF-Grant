  "body": "I think it's a good practice to have lines in our .pod6 files wrapped at around 72 characters (with some exceptions). This is the case for many parts of the documentation, but not all contributors are doing that. In the end we have files with mixed line lengths.\r\n\r\nShould we just autowrap the whole repo? Or should we add a file to xt/ that will give warnings for too long lines?",
