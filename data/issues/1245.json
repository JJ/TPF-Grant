  "body": "[Reported by Zefram](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130984):\r\n\r\n> The (intentional) treatment of Pair elements in List-to-Set coercion is rather surprising, and therefore ought to be thoroughly documented. There is a description of it in the Set documentation, in some general remarks that are not specific about the source type, but no mention of it on the List side. Since coercion manifests as a method on the source type, List is if anything the more obvious place to look. There should be some mention of the coercion behaviour in the List documentation. Similar remarks apply, to some extent, to other Iterable/Positional types, such as Seq, on the source side. (The same thing happens to Pairs in Seq-to-Set coercion, and Seq's documentation makes no mention of it.) For those types that are actually subclasses of List, though, it might be thought that documentation in List itself is sufficient to cover the subclasses. \r\n\r\nSee also: [RT #130976](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130976)",
