I have cloned every repo in the ecosystem. Then, with a bit of magic, I got this:\n\n```\n  702 total                          ← couldn't clone 7 modules (709 modules in ecosystem)\n\n  476 no shebang\n   78 #!perl6\n   68 #!/usr/bin/env perl6\n   61 no tests                       ← :(\n   11 can't decide                   ← different shebang lines in test files\n    3 #!/usr/bin/perl6\n    1 #!/usr/local/bin/perl6\n    1 #! /usr/bin/env perl6\n    1 #! /Users/damian/bin/rakudo*   ← oops\n    1 #!perl6                        ← with trailing whitespace\n    1 #! perl6\n```\n\nYou can see lists of modules for every shebang here: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/b5e15174c624f95ae50334ddd23f546f\n\nNote that these stats do not show modules that have a shebang line in some files but not in others (they are shown as having one shebang). Also, there may be some false matches.\n\nUm, so what's the conclusion?\n",
