  "body": "This is a quite simple implementation of generated page caching.\n\nIt can generate cache, update cache for new and changed pod6-files. With --sparse=5 time difference between cached and non-cached run on my machine is about 8x, without is about 9-10x.\n\nIt brings new dependency - Digest::MurmurHash3, it's the only one quite consistent hash function I found in the ecosystem. If anyone knows better(and more light-weight) tool - it will be appreciated. But since it's a C bindings, it's quite fast and simple.\n\nI prefer explicit typing style, but if some things can be more clear or concise, I'd like to know about them(I'm not an idiomatic Perl 6 pro).\n\nI suppose, for a documentation main server we shouldn't use cache(it can be disabled using command-line argument), but for local make it seems good enough.\n",
