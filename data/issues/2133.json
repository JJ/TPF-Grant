Non-star versions should probably wait.\r\n* If you change an example to use the new feature, leave the old example (at least while it's not obsolete) for people who has not upgraded yet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Any more suggestions? This is related to #302 , but that would be major. This, however, would avoid confusion.",
