  "body": "From [5to6-perlvar](http://doc.perl6.org/language/5to6-perlvar):\n\n> Replaced in Perl 6 by $*INITITME. Unlike in Perl 5, this is not in seconds since epoch, but an Instant object, which is measured in atomic seconds, with fractions.\n\nOK, let's try it.\n\nCode:\n\n``` perl6\nsay $*INITITME\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\nDynamic variable $*INITITME not found\n  in block <unit> at -e line 1\n\nActually thrown at:\n  in block <unit> at -e line \n```\n\n---\n\n```\n<bartolin> AlexDaniel: is the last one not just a typo?\n```\n\nWhoops. Yep.\n\nWhile we are at it, I believe that this is usually done by using `BEGIN now`. Perhaps it should mention `BEGIN now`?\n\nBut there is a slight difference:\nCode:\n\n``` perl6\nsay $*INITTIME;\nsay BEGIN now\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\nInstant:1462717691.553166\nInstant:1462717691.709836\n```\n",
