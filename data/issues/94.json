  "body": "As I see it, the advantages in writing a `p6doc-server` intended to be run as a background process are:\n- Significantly speed up command-line queries, which are currently slowed significantly by slurping in `%data` for every invocation. Instead `p6doc-server` exposes all the `%data` search functionality in the server and exposes it via an API.\n- By default it would simply serve the static output of `htmlify`. However, `p6doc-server` could provide the substrate for various other browser-oriented approaches.\n- Theming of `htmlify` could be easily modularized: `p6doc-server --theme Themes::P6Doc::HTML::Dark`\n\nIt also serves a personal goal of digging a bit further into `Promise`s and all the other async goodness.\n\nBefore I start hacking away madly, I wanted to check that everybody agrees that it makes sense and that there are not serious disadvantages to this approach. Enthusiasm can provide powerful blinders sometimes.\n",
