  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe documentation mentions [the system shell](https://docs.perl6.org/routine/shell). But there can be many different shells in a single system. So it's good to know which one is actually being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\n@timo's [answer in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50029941/which-shell-does-perl-6s-shell-use) suggests to look at the shell. Can be copied pretty much verbatim.  \r\n",
