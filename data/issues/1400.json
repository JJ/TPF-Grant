  "body": "Every now and then, someone gets they idea that they can use `[Z]` to create the transpose of a list-of-lists:\r\n\r\n``` perl6\r\nmy @matrix = <X Y>, <a b>, <1 2>;\r\nmy @transpose = [Z] @matrix;\r\n\r\nsay @transpose;  # [(X a 1) (Y b 2)] -- so far so good\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd everything works fine... until you get an input `@matrix` with **exactly one** row (child list):\r\n\r\n``` perl6\r\nmy @matrix = <X Y>,;\r\nmy @transpose = [Z] @matrix;\r\n\r\nsay @transpose;  # [(X Y)] -- not the expected transpose [(X) (Y)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've explained the cause of this surprising edge-case behavior, which basically ruins `[Z]` for variable-size inputs, in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44831926/1160124) (which should be easy to understand without also having to read the associated SO question).\r\n\r\nI think this has all the markings of a trap:\r\n\r\n* The syntax is simple (so people will continue to \"discover\" it), and elegant (so they'll be happy to use it).\r\n* It's quite sensible to expect, on first sight, that it will do the right thing.\r\n* It does in fact do the right thing for *most* inputs, meaning that it might slip through unit tests etc.\r\n\r\nThus, I think the Perl 6 documentation should mention it in its \"[Traps to avoid](https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps)\" document.\r\n",
