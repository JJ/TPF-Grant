  "body": "The [temp docs](https://docs.perl6.org/routine/temp) seems to say opposite things about resetting values:\r\n\r\n> \"temporizes\" the variable passed as the argument, which means it is reset to its old value on scope exit. (This is similar to the local operator in Perl 5, except that temp does not reset the value).\r\n\r\nIn the first sentence it says it \"reset[s]\", but the second says \"does not reset\". Perhaps there's some other distinction intended.",
