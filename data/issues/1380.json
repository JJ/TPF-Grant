While the Synopsis makes it clear that `%()` is strongly preferred for creating Hash's, and `{ }` is a conveinence backcompatibility, the documentation is not as strongly worded.\r\n\r\nThe [Hash](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Hash) docs page mainly uses the `{ }` and then tells you to use many tricks to try and avoid the pitfalls of using these, when it sometimes will create a Block not a Hash.\r\n\r\nFirstly the Hash page needs to be updated to use `%( )` extensively and saying that `{ }` is provided for convenience. We can explain the pitfalls as a **reason** to always use `%( )`, instead of explaining what to do *if* `{ }` doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we need to update the rest of the docs to also use `%( )`, in places where it makes sense.",
