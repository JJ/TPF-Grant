  "body": "Ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall#Passing_and_Returning_Values\r\n \r\nThe docs say there is no support for calling C functions with \"int\" because Perl6's \"int\" is not guaranteed to be the same size as a C int.  The docs list other platform-dependent-size types which _are_ supported,\r\nsuch as \"long\", \"longlong\" and \"ulong\", but emphaticically say:\r\n\r\n    \"Don't use Perl 6 native types like int or num, as they don't have to \r\n    correspond to the local C equivalent (e.g., Perl 6's int can be 8 bytes \r\n    but C's int is only 4 bytes).\"\r\n\r\nThis is pretty seriously confusing, IMO, and will forever cause programmers to write non-portable NativeCall interfaces.  \r\n\r\nI'm wondering *why* this is the case, i.e., that a P6 \"int\" can not be guaranteed to match \"int\" in C?  Does perl6 internally use \"int\" in its implementation, or does the P6 language spec specify a minimum size?\r\n\r\nIf P6 \"int\" really must not necessarily match C \"int\", then:\r\n\r\n    1) P6 should define another so-called native type which _is_ \r\n       guaranteed to be a \"C int\" on the execution platform; and\r\n\r\n    2) Use of \"int\" in a CStruct, or similar context should cause an error\r\n       to protect programmers from thinking they are writing portable code.\r\n\r\n(Also: Need support for C \"unsigned\" a.k.a. \"unsigned int\")\r\n\r\nNote: In C, \"int\" and \"unsigned\", have a platform-dependent size, ultimately determined by the C compiler & compile-time-options.\r\n\r\nANSI C99 specifies that \"int\" may have any size >= 16 bits.\r\n",
