  "body": "I think we could make it clearer that slicing adverbs on hashes etc. are defined on the operators themselves (see [Hash#Subscript_Adverbs](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Hash#Subscript_Adverbs), for example); I remember reading through the docs a while back and wondering how `:exists` interacted with indexing.\r\n\r\nExplicitly documenting that these adverbs are just arguments to the `postcircumfix:<{ }>` multi would probably makes things clearer for beginners.",
