  "body": "If I search for a term on docs.perl.org by typing in the search box and hitting return (so, not selecting something from the menu that pops up), I get the first thing in that menu. For instance, typing out \"encoding\" has a popup menu that only lists \"study\", so I get \"study\" if I hit return without selecting from the menu.\r\n\r\nA \"search this site with Google\" option would be nice. Or even a different search box for that function.\r\n\r\n",
