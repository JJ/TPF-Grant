  "body": "Edits to the Grammar Tutorial. I've attempted to tighten up the description of how the proto token works, and specifically focus on the utilisation of the ``<sym>`` token. I also removed the use of ``$<command><sym>`` in the Grammar Actions class, using instead just ``$<command>``.\r\n\r\nMaking a PR for this, since there maybe a bit of discussion on this. I've checked over and over again, that my statements are in tune with what the proto-regex is doing. I'm happy to receive comments to the opposite however.\r\n\r\nI've built the html docs on my local machine and the grammar_tutorial looks good.  ",
