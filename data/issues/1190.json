  "body": "This PR is heading to deal with our absence of `~` character explanation in regexes.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I just copied a description from https://design.perl6.org/S05.html#New_metacharacters and polished it a bit.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find traces of this `:dba` adverb, is it alive and undocumented? The first paragraph of explanation seems good for me, but the further part needs clarification and proving.\r\n\r\nAlso, much appropriate examples will be good to have.\r\n\r\n~~**Do not merge this yet, though reviews are needed.**~~",
