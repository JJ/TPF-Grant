  "body": "According to http://doc.perl6.org/language/concurrency#Channels, \"[b]ecause looping over a channel in this manner [with $channel.poll and $channel.closed] is a common pattern there is a simpler functional syntax to do this\", namely the \"loop-earliest-more\" syntax. The wording make it sound as both syntaxes should be equivalent.\n\nHowever, the \"loop-earliest-more\" syntax results in an unwanted shared state between Class _instances_, while the classic syntax does not exhibit this problem.\n\nSee short runnable and commented code examples: https://gist.github.com/nxadm/6d867ad7410330d1bfac\n\nThis bug is reported here to know if this different behaviour should be documented (a feature ;) ) or just a bug.\n\nThank you,\n\nC.\n",
