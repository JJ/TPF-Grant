  "body": "The Syntax doc, [docs.perl6.org/language/syntax](https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax), has a sentence about Unicode that says that Perl 6 is Unicode text but does seem to advertise applications of Unicode source, other than maybe the hyper operator.  I think it might be helpful for the description of identifiers to mention the use of alternative lettering/writing systems from Unicode as well as mathematical symbols as mentioned in a [Rosetta Code example](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Unicode_variable_names#Perl_6).  It may also be useful to discuss the use of Unicode subscripts and superscripts and the exclusion of numeric Unicode subscripts and superscripts from identifiers (see discussions [IRC #perl6 2016-04-14](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-04-14#i_12340102) and an [AlexDaniel gist](https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/c89bd2786f9b63f31e4c)).  My knowledge in this area is limited and there are likely to be other applications of Unicode source code that I have overlooked.",
