  "body": "In the comparison of Perl 6 with Ruby, it says Ruby lacks a smart match operator and uses == instead. This isn't quite right. Ruby uses the `===` method, which performs a similar function to `~~`. So `Class === foo` matches if `foo` is a `Class`, `/rx/ === foo` matches if the regular expression matches `foo`, `1 === foo` matches if `foo` equals 1, `'string' === foo` matches ... In general `===` delegates to `==`, but it is overridden in `Class` and regular expressions, and can be overridden as needed to make case statements work more intuitively in other ways.",
