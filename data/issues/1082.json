  "body": "The [documentation for my](https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/my) starts with:\r\n\r\n> Declaring a variable with my gives it lexical scope.\r\n\r\nBut this isn't true in the sense that people expect since it does something different with dynamic variables (those with the * twigil). [S04](https://design.perl6.org/S04.html#___top) says:\r\n\r\n> We use the phrase \"lexical scoping\" in its industry-standard meaning to indicate those blocks that surround the current textual location.\r\n\r\nAnd later, \r\n\r\n> Except for such formal parameter declarations, all lexically scoped declarations are visible from the point of declaration to the end of the enclosing block. Period. Lexicals may not \"leak\" from a block to any other external scope \r\n\r\nBut, that's not what `my` does with dynamic variables, say, as in Moritz's [Testing say](https://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6) article) where he temporarily replaces `$*OUT`'s value for a different scope that doesn't enclose it: \r\n\r\n\tmy $output = do {\r\n\t\tmy $*OUT = OutputCapture.new;\r\n\t\tdoublespeak(42);\r\n\t\t$*OUT.captured;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nThere's a cryptic note at the end of the my docs that seems to contradict the rest of the documentation so far:\r\n\r\n> To make new-location() print nowhere, make $location a dynamic variable using the * twigil.\r\n\r\nThat is, if `$location` were `$*location`, it's not a lexical variable anymore despite the `my`.\r\n\r\nThe example for the [* Twigil](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#The_*_Twigil) shows the same thing. A dynamic variable declared with `my` isn't lexical in the sense that S04 defines or that people will expect.",
