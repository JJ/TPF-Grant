  "body": "The largest of the changes here is the documenting of the redo method on\r\nLabel. Also made some modifications for the existing label examples.\r\n\r\nChanged the example for the next method so that it's output differs from\r\nthat of the last example. With the change, the numbers 5 through 10 are\r\nprinted, which makes it more clear that the loop has iterated a total of\r\nten times but only reached the print statement during 6 of those.\r\n\r\nAlso, added the output to the example, as I believe that is clearer and\r\nallows better visualization of what occurred. It also is more consistent with\r\nthe example-then-output style used throughout the docs.\r\n\r\nThese example changes are largely subjective, but I think they are for the allow\r\nfor better clarity / consistency.",
