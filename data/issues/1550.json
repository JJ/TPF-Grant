  "body": "The current documentation of [`|` alternations](https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Longest_Alternation:_|) is regrettably short and inaccurate.\r\n\r\nThis is causing users to get confused about what `|` actually does - see e.g. #1141 and the multiple Rakudo RT's that have popped up (and been rejected) about this.\r\n\r\nThis really needs to be explained much more accurately.\r\n\r\n### Resources:\r\n\r\n* The design docs have a long wall of text about it [S05#Longest-token_matching](http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Longest-token_matching).  \r\n  (As well as some more relevant stuff in  [S05#Overview](http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Overview) and the intro blurb above it.)\r\n* In [RT #132066](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132066), I tried to give a short explanation for the basic rule.\r\n\r\nEssentially, what `|` does is this:\r\n\r\n1. Select the branch whose **declarative prefix** matches the longest string.\r\n1. If it's a tie, select the match with the **highest specificity**.\r\n1. If it's still a tie, use additional tie-breakers.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is in...\r\n\r\n* Thoroughly explaining the bolded parts in a way that newbies will find intuitive, without sacrificing conciseness.  \r\n  *(For completeness, and to help users think in these terms, the documentation of all other regex constructs should probably be extended to mention whether they are considered declarative or procedural.)*  \r\n  \r\n* Reaching clarity on what \"additional tie-breakers\", exactly, apply to `|`.  \r\n  *(The tie-breaker stuff in S05 seems to have been written largely with LTM of [`proto`-regexes](https://design.perl6.org/S05.html#line_1348) in mind &ndash; some of it [cannot apply](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-01-20#i_13960983) to LTM of `|`, and some of it [is a bit ambiguous](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130612) w.r.t. to how it should apply to `|`.)*\r\n\r\nAlso note that Rakudo currently has at least two LTM bugs:\r\n\r\n* [RT #122951](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122951)\r\n* [RT #130612](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130612)\r\n\r\n(Although those are edge cases, and shouldn't distract from the fact that Rakudo *is* mostly S05-compliant on this topic, and last I heard Perl 6.c *is* supposed to implement LTM as specced by S05.)",
