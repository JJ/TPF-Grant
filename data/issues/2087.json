  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe [Subrules section of Regex](https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Subrules) incorrectly says ...\r\n\r\n> A named regex can be declared with `my regex named-regex { body here }` ...\r\n> If no capture is desired, a leading dot will suppress it: `<.named-regex>`.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a lexical token, capture suppression is done with `<&named-regex>` ... see also discussion from rakudo issue - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1894#issuecomment-393977196\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\nI guess predefined tokens like `<ws>` and `<alpha>` are methods and capture suppression is done with `<.alpha>` unlike a lexical token.  Capture of grammar regexes declared without `my`/`our` are also methods and their capture suppression is done with `<.grammar-regex>`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n    The template below contains optional suggestions. If you cannot\r\n    provide some information, simply omit it.\r\n\r\n    Please state clearly in \"The problem\" whether you are reporting a\r\n    problem with the site (something does not show up in the search\r\n    drop-down menu or a page is missing, for instance), documentation\r\n    text or examples that are missing or should be improved or\r\n    something else. Describe clearly the problem and the page where\r\n    you found it.\r\n\r\n    If applicable, tell us in \"Suggestions\" what could be done to\r\n    solve the problem, such as \"Rephrase the description\" or \"Use an\r\n    example program that actually runs\".\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",
