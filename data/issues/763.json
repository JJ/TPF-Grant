  "body": "Plain text file because it's universal for all.\n\nI've left js syntax here, because it's easy and we don't have to do anything else with source file.\n\nI want opinions about - is it needed to change file to some format and then parse it in `htmlify`(if someone hates piece of js code in some outer file)? Maybe like this:\n\n```\nCategory\nValue\nUrl\n\nCategory\n...\n```\n\nit is quite easy file format and I can implement this.\n\nAbility to make links that point to just pages, not anchors, is quite good for search, for example, see https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/724\n",
