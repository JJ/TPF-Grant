Type declarators includes a section on \"Introspecton\", another subsection on \"Attributes\" with a subsection on \"private attributes\" and that's it... \r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nThe general text seems to be OK, but it could use some systematization and organization in sections and subsections and introductions to them, at least at the first and second level.
