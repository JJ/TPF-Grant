  "body": "From the [log stats](http://www.p6c.org/stats/doc.perl6.org), apparently the page that gets the most visits is [the automatically generated `language` index page](https://docs.perl6.org/language.html). It's probably not the best introduction to it, but SEO rules (see #1824) so we'll have to work on that. \r\nI'd like to know where the visits come from, since [it does not seem to show up in the first page of several searches](https://www.google.es/search?safe=off&client=ubuntu&hs=JiY&channel=fs&dcr=0&biw=1920&bih=970&ei=Ewe-Wp-QBYauUbicsfgG&q=%22perl+6%22&oq=%22perl+6%22). Anyway, lots of visits, so maybe a short introduction would help. ",
