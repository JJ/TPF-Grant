  "body": "As mentioned in https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/757#issuecomment-234834178, such examples are present in `doc/Type/List.pod6`, but it probably exists in other files as well.\n\nI think that if the example has “say” in it, then we should provide non-mangled output.\n\nSure, parens are not a big deal, but still people may start asking questions like “is it up to date?”.\n\nSo what do you think? Should we always provide the output as is, or maybe changing it a little bit improves readability?\n",
