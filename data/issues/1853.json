  "body": "Specifically, if you write code like:\r\n\r\n--cut here--\r\nmethod TOP( $/ ) {\r\n    my $v = ~$/ ~~ /foo/;\r\n}\r\n--cut here--\r\n\r\nattempting the /foo/ match fails because $/ is a readonly argument resulting in the error below:\r\n\r\n--cut here--\r\nCannot assign to a readonly variable ($/) or a value.\r\n--cut here--\r\n\r\nwhich is entirely correct, but it may not be obvious that $/ is readonly because you're passing the match as an argument. Granted, it's right there a few lines above, but it confused me.\r\n\r\nMaybe the error could be changed to:\r\n--cut here--\r\nCannot assign to the argument $/.\r\n--cut here--\r\n\r\nin this case.",
