  "body": "Ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall#Arrays\r\n\r\nThe NativeCall doc says  \"CArray[int32]\" interfaces to \"int* in C, an array of ints\"\r\n\r\nbut this is not correct if sizeof(int) != 32 in C on the execution platform.  This is related to the issue of not having support for a \"native\" P6 type which is guaranteed to be a \"C int\".  Something like \"CArray[xxx]\" is needed, where \"xxx\" is a type guaranteed to correspond to \"int\" in C (and also something for \"unsigned\").\r\n\r\nCorrected documentation might say\r\n\r\n >   CArray[int32] interfaces to \"int32_t* in C, an array of 32-bit ints\"\r\n",
