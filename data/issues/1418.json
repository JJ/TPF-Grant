  "body": "While browsing the traps section I came across the examples traps in \"quotes and interpolation\", and the \"Perl 6 understands that as ...\"  answers looked all wrong to me.  Here are my suggested corrections.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the \"You can avoid those problems ... \"  section looks equally confusing to me -- I know Perl 6 (or think that I do) and yet I have to really work to figure out what the alternative is accomplishing.  Jumping straight into qq[] and :c feels very line-noisey to me.\r\n\r\nTo me some much simpler alternatives might be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   \"$foo\\<html></html>\"\r\n   \"{$foo}<html></html>\"\r\n\r\n   \"{$foo}(\" ~ @args ~ \")\"\r\n   \"$foo\\(@args[])\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPm",
