  "body": "The Type Graphs appear in arbitrary places.  E.g.\n- Baggy -- at the end after \"Methods\" and \"See also\"\n- Bag -- after \"Creating\", \"Operators\", \"Subroutines\", \"See Also\", but before \"Routines supplied...\"\n- Callable -- at the end after \"Methods\" and \"Operators\"\n- IO -- at the end after \"Routines\" and \"Related Classes\"\n- Capture -- after \"Methods\" and before \"Routines supplied...\"\n- FatRat -- before \"Routines supplied...\"\n- Int -- after \"Methods\" and \"Operators\", before \"Routines supplied\"\n\nThere's obviously some logic as it's machine generated (apparently after supplied docs but before all other auto-generated docs), but having it wedged between \"Methods\" and \"Routines supplied by\" seems a weird place.  I'd suggest putting it at the bottom.\n\nThe Type Graphs are also not in the TOC (https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/641) for a given type, so unless it happens to be visible, you don't know where to find it.\n",
