  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nWe don't have a description on how %?RESOURCES variable works, which may be quite important.\r\n\r\nI believe(though feel free to discuss), the docs should cover at least such topics:\r\n\r\n* What is %?RESOURCES variable?\r\n* How can one populate it with META6.json file?\r\n* How it works(a client API side, e.g. what it contains, how to use it to get data, showing an example).\r\n* How to test code that involves %?RESOURCES usage, explicitly note if it works out of the box, if not - provide some nice pattern to mock this data or to give some design tips on it.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nWe need someone who knows answers to the question above to write some explanations.",
