  "body": "## The problem\r\nIt would be very convenient to have the whole docs file in epub (or mobi, or fb2) format to use it on Kindles and other e-ink devices. The crucial thing is to convert the documents multilevel structure into epub/mobi's bookmarks, otherwise it's impossible to navigate a file of several thousand kindle screens.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\nTo have epub/mobi versions of the docs with TOC, which should be kept up-to-date to reflect current updates to the docs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n    The template below contains optional suggestions. If you cannot\r\n    provide some information, simply omit it.\r\n\r\n    Please state clearly in \"The problem\" whether you are reporting a\r\n    problem with the site (something does not show up in the search\r\n    drop-down menu or a page is missing, for instance), documentation\r\n    text or examples that are missing or should be improved or\r\n    something else. Describe clearly the problem and the page where\r\n    you found it.\r\n\r\n    If applicable, tell us in \"Suggestions\" what could be done to\r\n    solve the problem, such as \"Rephrase the description\" or \"Use an\r\n    example program that actually runs\".\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",
