This is not exactly a language trap, but just a common mistake.\r\n\r\nHere's the code:\r\n\r\n```perl6\r\nmy $x = ‘test’;\r\nmy $y = ‘hello world’;\r\nsay so $y ~~ /^ $<start>=[\\w+]  \\s+ $<end>=[\\w+] $/; # ← some complex regex capturing stuff\r\n# … a few lines of code here\r\nexit if ‘x’ ~~ /^‘Z’/;\r\n# … a few lines of code here\r\nsay $<start>, ‘ ↔ ’, $<end>; # ← OOPS!!\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nTrue\r\nNil ↔ Nil\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it worth documenting on https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps? Can anybody else confirm that this is something they get into sometimes?",
