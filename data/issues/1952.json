  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nSeveral utility programs build a cache of Pod 6 documents, only they do so in different ways.\r\n\r\n- htmlify puts it in a global variable, `$*DR`\r\n- pod-valid.t just ditches of the file as soon as it's checked.\r\n- pod2onepage actually *builds* and puts it in a `.precomp` data store, used as a cache. That is why when you change just one page it says `(cached)`\r\n- p6doc creates one `index.data` file, which is not used by anyone else.\r\n\r\nBaseline is: many programs, some of them run in sequence, load and build Perl 6 objects out of Pod 6 files only to ditch it later. We should make them use the same objects, precomputed if they are available. \r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nCould we maybe take a look at all this and create a single cache for docs that could speed up at least local testing? Would be part of #1823, but not the whole lot, of course... ",
