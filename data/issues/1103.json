  "body": "This is a continuation of [RT #130480](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130480).\r\n\r\n[Our docs say](https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#index-entry-lazy_list_%E2%80%A6):\r\n> The sequence operator is a generic operator to produce lazy lists.\r\n\r\nWell, is it? Seems like it produces ``Seq``-s, not lazy lists. Lazy lists can be obtained, for example, from ``.list``-ing a Range (``..`` operator, not ``...``), or by ``lazy``-ing a Seq.\r\n\r\nAnd getting back to the ticket:\r\n```\r\nmy @a = 1 … 9999999\r\n```\r\n↑ This is not lazy at all. But with our current documentation it is fair to assume that it *should* be lazy.\r\n\r\nWe should improve our docs on ``…`` first. Then perhaps document another trap?",
