  "body": "I saw [\"I tried to find the \" $ \" in the documentation but couldn't find it.\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49375773/perl-6-curried-function-hangs#comment85753649_49376083).\r\n\r\nI think the closest the docs currently come to what that user needed is [The $ Variable](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#The_$_Variable). (It looks like that section could do with a mention of how `$` can be used to mark an unused parameter. Same goes for doc for `@` and `%`.)\r\n\r\nI tried typing `$` in the search box. It does not have an entry that links to the doc section I just linked.\r\n\r\n(There is an entry toward the end of the large menu that says `$ (variable)`. But that turns out to be an entry for `$<named> (variable)`. You can see this if you use the cursor keys to select it from the menu. The entry is both incorrectly displayed in the menu *and* has a link that lands it at the right page but at the top rather than at the right place for the *Named Attributes* section that discusses `$<named>` variables. I searched for tickets matching `$<named>` and found none. Do we need to create a further one or two new issues to cover these `$<named>` problems?)\r\n\r\nFinally, I can also imagine folk typing `$` to get help on `$` as a sigil, and that doesn't seem to be available either, beyond the item contextualiser stuff. I'd expect a link to [Sigils](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#Sigils) as well as a link to *The $ variable*.",
