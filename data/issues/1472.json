  "body": "Let's make a file:\r\n```bash\r\nperl6 -e 'spurt ‘file’, “foox\\nfooy\\rbar\\nfooz\\n”'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say (on linux at least) that this file has three lines:\r\n<pre>\r\nfoox\r\nfooy<b>\\r</b>bar\r\nfooz\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd any proper command line tool in existence will treat it as such. ``wc -l`` says 3, ``grep foo`` will give the whole line also (your terminal may print it in a weird way, but that's still treated as a whole line).\r\n\r\nSo let's try reading this file in perl 6:\r\n```bash\r\nperl6 -e 'dd $_ for lines' < file\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\"foox\"\r\n\"fooy\\rbar\"\r\n\"fooz\"\r\n```\r\n↑ This is entirely right.\r\n\r\nBut here's a trap:\r\n```bash\r\nperl6 -e 'dd $_ for slurp.lines' < file\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\"foox\"\r\n\"fooy\"\r\n\"bar\"\r\n\"fooz\"\r\n```\r\nIt turns out that ``lines`` and ``slurp.lines`` work differently, which is really surprising. Also, [I managed to get into this trap at least once](https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/commit/39e5c538255db9135e2303aa7ea1e1b5f65135a9).",
