It isn't clear in current docs that Test is a core module, and thus a casual user has to search a while for its source.  A section on core modules would be helpful, perhaps referenced on the page where the external modules are listed: https://modules.perl6.org/.\n\nAnother place to reference them would be to add another category, \"Core Modules,\" on this page: https://doc.perl6.org/\n",
