  "body": "(Continues discussion in commit e01b3ca) \r\nSome examples get warnings when test-compiled. Most are of this kind\r\n```\r\nWARNINGS for /home/jmerelo/Code/forks/perl6/doc/EVAL_76:\r\nUseless use of constant string \"...\" in sink context (lines 4, 5)\r\nok 73 - doc/Language/5to6-perlfunc.pod6 chunk 12 starts with “q/.../” compiles\r\n```\r\n(You've probably realized I've added the `starts with` in 4eda9f8 to make the identication of said chunks easier)\r\nThis particular one relates to `    q/.../;  # is still equivalent to using single quotes. ` which is a syntactically fine construct, but it's not so good according to this issue #1748 I raised some time ago: express intent with examples. My point is that warnings *warn* about something, and maybe we should pay some attention to them.\r\nBesides, there are not so many, and they can be dealt with easily. It can help improve the documentation too. Probably not a priority, but useful anyway. \r\nAnother option is to add `:skip-test` to those pieces of code, and of course to turn warnings into errors. \r\n\r\n",
