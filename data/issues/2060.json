  "body": "## The problem\r\nThe [regex documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Predefined_Character_Classes) says that `<alpha>` is \"Alphabetic characters\" but, unlike POSIX `[:alpha:]` and adhering to [Synopsis 5](http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Predefined_Subrules), Perl 6 `<alpha>` includes the '\\_' (underscore) character.  The documentation gives `:L` as a shorthand for `<alpha>` but that is not really correct since `:L` does not include '\\_'.  [Synopsis 5](http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Predefined_Subrules) specifies `<:alpha>` to match without '\\_'.  `<:alpha>`  seems to be implemented and seems equivalent to `:L` but I don't know how `<:property>` classes are implemented and am not sure.  The documentation gives `<alnum>` as \"\\<alpha\\> plus \\<digit\\>\" which is correct since both contain '\\_' but may surprise anyone who expects POSIX `[:alnum:]`.  [Synopsis 5](http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Predefined_Subrules) does not mention `<:alnum>` which may be cause for an RFC and maybe `<+:L +:Nd>` is an alternative.\r\n\r\n",
