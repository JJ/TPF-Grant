  "body": "The docs imply that    `say $!.backtrace`    would print a human-readable backtrace, but actually it just prints \"Backtrace.new\".  [Using Rakudo  2017.06]. Assuming this is correct behavior (I'm unqualified to judge), then it is confusing to use this construct in code examples where the reader is likely to think that an actual backtrace would appear.   Suggest changing the examples to code which produces a backtrace for human consumption...\r\n\r\n ref: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Exception#method_backtrace\r\n ref: https://docs.perl6.org/type/X::AdHoc\r\n\r\nPlease see the example for `method backtrace` in class `Exception`, and\r\nthe first general example in docs for class `X::AdHoc`.\r\n",
