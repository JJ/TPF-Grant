  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nInitially, whilst running 'make install' of Rakudo Star 2018.04, I noticed p6doc 'FAIL - proceeding with force install' or something like that. Rakudo Star itself installed correctly, and zef works fine because I subsequently installed cro and dependencies without a problem.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to install a local html copy of the docs, as a test. I cloned perl6/doc from github to a local dir, and found that 'make html' from within the doc directory fails. \r\n\r\nTwo log files capture the 'make html' error :\r\n\r\n[make_p6doc_html.txt](https://github.com/perl6/doc/files/1985556/make_p6doc_html.txt)\r\n[npm-debug.log](https://github.com/perl6/doc/files/1985558/npm-debug.log)\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nHopefully the log info will help to shed light on what causes the failure.\r\n\r\n",
