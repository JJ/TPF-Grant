  "body": "There are [a number of issues involving htmlify.p6](https://github.com/perl6/doc/search?q=htmlify.p6&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93). There is also some repeated code, for instance `badchars-ntfs` is redefined in htmlify.p6 although it's included in the module, and `badchars-unix` is re-defined with a different value. htmlify.p6 has lots of methods that could maybe be moved to Htmlify.pm6, and then there a group of methods: viz-*, write-* ... \r\nI wonder if we could kinda take a look at it and suggest some improvements to work on, speed and otherwise. Or, as suggested, just ditch it and change to a dynamic website.",
