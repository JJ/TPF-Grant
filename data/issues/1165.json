  "body": "**General description**\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/776) was raised a question about different styles of output of the examples. Soon it led to efforts to make examples extracted and executed automatically(with @gfldex++ support) and thoughts about automatic checking of output correctness(not yet).\r\n\r\nSo this PR introduces a migration of Type/ directory files to a style that was proposed by @coke, simply saying:\r\n- say 3; # OUTPUT: «3␤»\r\n- 2+5; # RESULT: «7»\r\n- 2+5i; # this is a complex number\r\n\r\n**Why is single style important**\r\n\r\n* Inconsistency is bad for the reader. We have `#!>` in some places, `OUTPUT«`, `# prints` and others without any logic between usages.\r\n* We cannot adequately write a tool to automate our examples testing without some machine-easy recognizable style.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n* With unified style we can check our examples(it is important - the wrong examples are tedious to catch by hands and it confuses reader).\r\n* With unified style we can easily convert it to other styles automatically.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n* While working on it, I noticed that in some rare places(Str.pod6, Date-related pod6 files, for example) this style of output is... A bit noisy to read. But it can be solved by simple \"stripping out\" this \"OUTPUT|RESULT\" things on pod6-to-html stage. Or this style can be changed automatically to something else.\r\n* It somewhat makes contribution harder. If we have a single style, we need to document it in CONTRIBUTION.md and stick to it.\r\n\r\n**Additional questions**\r\n\r\n* I don't know what to do with Language/ folder. Theoretically, we need to test it too, but it isn't even compileable(at this moment), so I didn't touch it. I also have concerns about \"Is this work needed at all?\"-part.\r\n* ~~There are conflicts now, but I still have some time and I will resolve them if this PR will be accepted as helpful.~~ I can do some additional work if needed.\r\n\r\n**Additional points**\r\n\r\n* I've reviewed it carefully and it(hopefully) doesn't introduce any typo. Instead, I've fixed a few.\r\n* It passes `make test` and `make xtest`.\r\n* I know that I'm leaving my \"trace\" all over the docs, 79 files were changed after all. Can't be helped.",
