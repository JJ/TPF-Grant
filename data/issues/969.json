  "body": "In the Packages language documentation, most of the examples given are incomplete, confusing, and some appear to just flat not work. If they work, I can't tell why they don't for me and some of the examples do not appear to be in roast anywhere that I can find.\n\nIt would be nice if all the examples shown actually work and it was clear what each symbolic dereference was referring to in an original. So provide a package definition like:\n\n``` perl6\nclass Foo {\n  class Bar {\n    sub baz { }\n    our $qux = 42;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, write each of the examples in terms of a defined symbol so we know what the symbol lookup actually does.\n\nFor example, I found the sudden, unexplained use of `$` to prefix symbolic dereferences in the first set of example to be confusing. The use of <::Bar> seems to be incorrect.\n\nAnyway, I think the examples need to be reworked.\n",
