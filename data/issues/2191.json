  "body": "It goes like this:\r\n\r\n> Other programming languages call that a hash table, dictionary, or map\r\n\r\n↑ that is fine, these are commonly used terms. Next sentence:\r\n\r\n> You can query a hash table for the value that corresponds to a certain $key with %hash{$key}[1].\r\n\r\nFirst of all, footnotes should not be used near code because `[1]` can look like a perl 6 syntax. Either way, what's in that footnote? (as a perl 6 beginner I'm interested!)\r\n\r\n>  [↑] Unlike Perl 5, in Perl 6 the sigil does not change when accessing an array or hash with [ ] or { }. This is called sigil invariance\r\n\r\nPerl 5? Sigil invariance? Why am I presented with all that?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow that I look at it, I think the whole document should reclassified as 5to6-101. For example:\r\n\r\n> Every Perl 6 program should begin with use v6;. This line tells the compiler which version of Perl the program expects. Should you accidentally run the file with Perl 5, you'll get a helpful error message.\r\n\r\n↑ not exactly? I don't think it's common that someone would executed a `⌁.p6` document that has a perl6 shebang with perl5.\r\n\r\nAssigning @JJ because he knows how to untangle stuff like this :)",
