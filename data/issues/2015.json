  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nLooking for `handles` to solve #761, I have found that file handle appear at least in that form or in the `filehandle` form. We should try and normalize terminology across all the documents, and this is only an example. When normalization is done, we should turn it into a test later on. \r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nAgree on one single form for terms that are frequently appearing in the documentation. Please add terms below, and let's discuss in the comments which form is preferred.\r\n\r\n* [ ] file handle, filehandle, file-handle → filehandle\r\n* [ ] runtime, run-time → runtime\r\n* [ ] short-hand, shorthand →shorthand\r\n* [ ] look-ahead, lookahead →lookahead\r\n* [ ] look-behind, lookbehind →lookbehind",
