  "body": "> \\<jmerelo\\> AlexDaniel: but I don't know what's introductory in perl6/doc.\r\n\r\nSo I went to [Language Documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/language.html) wearing the hat of a new user, and… I don't know either.\r\n\r\nThe documents are sorted alphabetically, so the very first thing I'm presented with is \"Classes and Objects\", and the second one is \"Concurrency\". One of the introductory topics—\"Variables\"—is very last in the list.\r\n\r\nThere's also a second problem with alphabetical sorting: related topics are quite far apart in the list: \"Classes and Objects\", \"Object Orientation\", and \"Meta-Object Protocol\" are related topics, yet the they're some ways apart from each other. We have \"Functions\" describing subs and \"Routines\" listing a few of core routines, and if I spotted the latter first, I might've assumed that's all there were for \"functions\" documentation.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest better ordering than alphabetic: order by difficulty, starting with most basic concepts first. I think some subsections grouping related topics could also be useful.",
