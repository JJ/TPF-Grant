  "body": "In S12 (Objects) in the section on attributes - http://design.perl6.org/S12.html#Attributes - there is a sentence that reads:  \"You may write your own accessors to override any or all of the autogenerated ones.\".  The same is supposed to be true about mutators for rw attributes but that does not seem to be documented anywhere.  After a discussion with moritz++ on irc, moritz felt that a Synopsis does not need to spell everything out and while custom mutators should be documented, that documentation belonged on Perl6/doc.  I don't really see where custom accessors are documented on Perl6/doc but, like accessors, custom mutators are supposed to be part of the Perl 6 language and that should be documented somewhere.\n\nThere is a work in progress roast test suite for custom object mutators here: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S12-attributes/mutators.t\n",
