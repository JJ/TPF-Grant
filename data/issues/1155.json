I just made it searchable. It still lacks of documentation, but we have two another issues about this matter: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/764 and https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/551. This is a temporary link until someone great enough will write a paragraph about meta-document with its own header.",
