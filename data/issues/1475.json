  "body": "`:my` and `:our` usage within regexes is not documented. For `:my`, something like this would be nice:\r\n\r\n`:my $foo = 0` is needed to declare a variable that has scope throughout and beyond the regex body, unlike variables declared in blocks. For example, the following trivial example shows a counter used for debugging:\r\n\r\n`$paragraph ~~ rx|\r\n    :my $counter = 0;\r\n    ( \\V* { ++$counter } ) *%% \\n\r\n|;\r\nsay \"Matched $counter lines\";`\r\n\r\nIf that's too verbose, a sentence or two could be added to the example that uses `:my` (but doesn't explain it).",
