  "body": "From [RT#126119](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126119)\n\n> > I documented the behavior and the workaround method for older compilers in the docs:\n> > https://docs.perl6.org/type/Instant#Future_Leap_Seconds\n> \n> That's certainly a significant improvement, thanks.  There are a couple\n> of issues with the wording, though.\n> \n> \"methods ... do not make any guesses\" isn't really true, because the\n> method does return a specific answer that implies a specific future leap\n> schedule.  From the point of view of the caller, it's guessing that there\n> will never be any more leap seconds after the last one it knows about.\n> If it signalled an error, that would constitute not guessing.\n> \n> Also, \"leap seconds in the future\" reads as if it's referring to the\n> future of when the method is called.  This could do with some rewording\n> in accordance with what we discussed upthread, to make clear that it may\n> apply to leap seconds in the past of the call time.  The true situation\n> is somewhat implied by the subsequent discussion of \"depending on the\n> compiler version\", but that comes across as conflicting with the \"in\n> the future\" rather than as clarifying it.\n> \n> Putting those together, I suggest that the first sentence of this doc\n> section should read\n> \n> > ```\n> >    The methods that involve knowledge of leap seconds always assume\n> >     that there will be no further leaps after the last leap second\n> >     that the implementation knows about, which may not be the last\n> >     leap second that has actually been scheduled.\n> > ```\n> \n> -zefram\n",
