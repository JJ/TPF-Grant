BTW, the former isn't documented.\r\n> Tison | It looks like the former is an assertion while the latter really matches something\r\n> Tison | our documentation on assertion only shows look-around assertions but no general assertion forms\r\n> timotimo | yeah, if you have a ? or ! after the < it becomes a zero-width matching assertion\r\n\r\n",
