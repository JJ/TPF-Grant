  "body": "* Make many examples compile by adding semicolons, adding actual test data, etc.\r\n* Add `:skip-test` directive to many examples. For further explanation see https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/776.\r\n* Use `table` instead of plain code where appropriately;\r\n* Reformatting of some old examples.\r\n\r\nSadly, this is not the end, just some preparation work; My further plan is:\r\n* To reformat results in this section too, just as for Type/.\r\n* To write an addition to the contribution guide about the output style.\r\n* To close this big issue.\r\n\r\nI wanted this to be merged quickly to prevent conflicts, since this work is slow and our commits to master are everyday thing. After that, I will be able to continue my work in a small chunks directly into the master to be closer to upstream.",
