  "body": "Imagine a `/language/faq-why.pod` doc page with a section header defined as:\n\n```\n=head2 Why sigils? Couldn't you do without them?\n```\n\nAnd now consider the following two URLs:\n\n```\nhttp://doc.perl6.org/language/faq-why#Why_sigils%3F_Couldn%27t_you_do_without_them%3F\n\nhttp://doc.perl6.org/language/faq-why#sigils\n```\n\nThe first is how the section would have to be linked to, the way things are now. The second is how I would like it to be.\n\nObviously, this would require some kind of markup in the POD to specify the desired ID. Maybe something along the lines of:\n\n```\n=head2 :id<sigils> Why sigils? Couldn't you do without them?\n```\n\n...but I don't know enough about the POD6 format to know whether that syntax even makes sense, or what the right approach would be.\n\nComments / suggestions?\n\nPS: Since p6doc simply lets Rakudo parse the .pod files, we can't just invent syntax willy-nilly. It has to somehow hook into the features that the POD6 format officially provides.\n",
