  "body": "The sub exit is documented as part of Any <https://docs.perl6.org/routine/exit> but that is not really true:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Any.exit;\r\nNo such method 'exit' for invocant of type 'Any'. Did you mean 'emit'?\r\n  in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, as far as I understand, exit is really implemented within the Rakudo (from Internals.pm):\r\n\r\n```\r\nRakudo::Internals.REGISTER-DYNAMIC: '&*EXIT', {\r\n    PROCESS::<&EXIT> := sub exit($status) {\r\n        state $exit;\r\n        $exit = $status;\r\n\r\n        once {\r\n            Rakudo::Internals.THE_END();\r\n            nqp::exit(nqp::unbox_i($exit.Int));\r\n        }\r\n        $exit;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that is correct, should we move &exit from Any to another place?\r\nSuggestions?",
