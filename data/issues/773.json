  "body": "> I'm a Perl 5 programmer. Where is a list of differences between Perl 5 and 6?\n> \n> See the pod with the 5to6- prefix under https://docs.perl6.org/language.html\n\nLet's just say “See [language/5to6-nutshell](https://docs.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell)”.\nHowever, we should also provide a link to https://docs.perl6.org/language/rb-nutshell, perhaps requires some rewording in the question.\n\nNow, this does not really tell about other 5to6 documents. I think that 5to6-nutshell page itself should provide these links on the top, so that we can point any Perl 5 user to that page and eventually he/she will find everything needed.\n",
