  "body": "There are [three different tests](https://github.com/perl6/doc/tree/master/xt): space-after-comma, trailing-whitespace and perl-nbsp. They kinda do the same: read lines in a file, check for stuff, consider exceptions. [`space-after-comma.t`](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/xt/space-after-comma.t) is the coolest (great job, @coke and @zoffixznet) doing stuff asynchronously, using promises. \r\nCould we maybe graft the other two into the first and refactor so that we can easily check for regexen + exceptions in a single file?",
