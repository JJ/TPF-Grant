  "body": "In some documentation files we have \"Usage\" section, like this:\n\n```\nDefined as:\n\n    multi method fmt(Pair:D:) returns Str:D {}\n\nUsage:\n\n    PAIR.fmt(FORMATSTRING)\n```\n\nJudging by grep, we have about 300 occurrences of such \"examples\". But, eh, is it really useful?\n\nIf we explain some method or subroutine, I think, anyone, who reads documentation, do know how to apply subroutines and call methods. For a method it's just `value.method-name(maybe-some-args)` - this formula doesn't change with every section, we just repeat useless stuff. We don't have any output example to be really useful for anyone in such sections, too. If we apply a function, it'll almost always(yes, perl 6 has many ways to call a subroutine, but that's not the case) be `sub-name(value, some-other-args)`.\nIs it me or this \"Usage\" sections are a bit redundant?\n\nSecondly, because we have \"fake\" arguments there, like \"PAIR\" or \"FORMATSTRING', it is impossible to check them with a compiler. I think, if we want to really show some usage, we need to rewrite all such strings as a proper examples, if we not, we need to remove such sections.\n",
