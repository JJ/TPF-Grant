  "body": "The [p5-p6 perlfunc for kill](https://docs.perl6.org/language/5to6-perlfunc#kill) says\r\n\r\n> Now part of the L<Proc::Async> class, but looks to work as in Perl 5.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this only lets you send a signal to a process you started and there's no (documented) way to provide a PID.\r\n\r\n    method kill(Proc::Async:D: $signal = \"HUP\") {\r\n        X::Proc::Async::MustBeStarted.new(:method<kill>, proc => self).throw if !$!started;\r\n        nqp::killprocasync($!process_handle, $*KERNEL.signal($signal));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat `killprocasync` is really in MoarVM as far as I can tell, but even at the NQP level I lose all my bearings. \r\n\r\nAs such, it seems this doesn't work at all like the Perl 5 version. It might be too late to change the name of the method so it doesn't carry the baggage of the expectations of the real thing called `kill`, but it doesn't work as it does in Perl 5. I'd probably document this as \"not in Perl 6, so shell out\". \r\n\r\nI wasn't so much interested in the termination aspects of kill as the \"is the process still running\" abilities, especially for processes not started by the one I'm currently in.\r\n\r\n",
