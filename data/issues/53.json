Especially from the unspoiled 'what would a new user need' perspective.\n\nBut even though I am not new to programming, not new to documenting code or writing docs in general and not even new to writing POD I am having a hard time to figure out where to actually start contributing.\n\nI am pretty sure a quick getting started guide could help a great deal to get drive-by contributions to the docs.\n",
