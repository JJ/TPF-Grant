  "body": "Looking at #178, I realized we have basically nothing about package namespaces spelled out. I found some material in S02 and started to chop it down -- this is my first pass. We can merge it as \"better than nothing\" if we like. I'll continue refining in any case.\n\nMostly I'd like feedback about WHERE are some good places to put this info. Language/modules was the first place I hit upon, but I also considered Language/packages as possibly it's own document.\n",
