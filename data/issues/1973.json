  "body": "## The problem\r\n- `app.pl` leaves behind two files in `/tmp` after running\r\n- `htmlify.pl6` leaves behind several thousand files if perl is killed before it finishes. Your OS may not be able to clear `/tmp` on boot when this happens because there are too many files to pass to `rm`\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n- I'm working on a fix for the first issue\r\n- Maybe a tmp dir should be made in the repo when running `htmlify.pl6` and removed after the script has finished. This would make removing files on SIGINT/SIGTERM a matter of just catching the signal and removing the entire directory\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n    The template below contains optional suggestions.
