  "body": "My \"Programming Perl\" 4th ed has a section called \"Accessing Overridden Methods\" in its chapter on objects.  There is a sentence for \"re-dispatch\" at the end of [language/classtut/#Overriding_inherited_methods](https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut#Overriding_inherited_methods) and `callsame` is mentioned for `BUILDALL` in the \"Object Orientation\" doc.  The [inheritance section in language/objects](https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Inheritance) doesn't mention re-dispatch and I think it should and give an example.  Maybe it can refer to the example for `BUILDALL` but that might be seen as a special case.  Neither Perl 6 document now really covers the concepts from \"Accessing Overridden Methods\" in \"Programming Perl\".\r\n\r\nSee also my confused [#perl6](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2018-03-28#i_15976203) discussion earlier today.",
