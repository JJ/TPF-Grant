  "body": "Pod documentation that is: `=begin code :allow<B L>` highlights as Pod not Perl 6 code. It is the :allow which causes this.\r\n\r\nhtmlify.p6 passes these as Pod to the highlighter, and so it gets highlighted as such (this is to allow us to make things bold/other styles).\r\n\r\nProposed solution from the docs side: we need to parse this Pod and strip it of Pod tags, and insert special Unicode control codes which nobody will have in normal text. These control codes can then be removed in the htmlify.p6 side once the highlighter highlights them.\r\n\r\nFrom the highlighter https://github.com/perl6/atom-language-perl6 side, we will tag these differently than normal code, so we can add that effect in the CSS.\r\n",
