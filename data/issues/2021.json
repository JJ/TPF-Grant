It will integrate travis tests in the \"check\" tag, much in the way it's done now with pushes.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nIt's free for open source projects, I can set it up straight away (or anyone else with the privs, for that matter). If you feel strongly against that, please let it be known in the comments. ",
