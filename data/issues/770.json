Well, not that it is wrong, but what about rakudobrew? Or are there any instructions we can link to? We can definitely provide some useful information here.\n\nEDIT: A-ha! Next question (well, it is not even a question) is `As an intermediate to advanced user I want to track Rakudo development.`, and the answer is to use rakudobrew. So, did I get it right that as an advanced user you can just run rakudobrew and it will install everything for you, but as a beginner you have to compile it yourself somehow, and surely you can figure out how to do that yourself? ;)\n\n> If you are a Windows 32 or 64 bit user then Rakudo Star **binaries** are also available at the rakudo site.\n\nBinaries? What binaries? Does .msi count as a binary?\n\n> To use panda (see below) to install library modules you will need git and Perl 5's Test::Harness.\n\n“see below” – where? 5 questions below this answer are about something else. Sure, it talks about [faq#Modules](https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq#Modules), but let's add a link or something.\n\n> There should be Linux and Mac binaries available shortly from vendors and third parties. Although vendor versions may be outdated.\n\n“Shortly”! OK, debian testing [has up-to-date rakudo](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=rakudo), perhaps we can say that one can use rakudo from debian testing, and that the next debian stable release will include it.\n",
