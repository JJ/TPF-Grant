  "body": "#1255 As with #1223 (and #732), I find that the idea of concept of context is diffuse. I think Perl 6 needs to have a section (somewhere) devoted just to context since this is a fundamental language concept.\r\n\r\nI don't have all the info that would need. Here are some notes I'm working on.\r\n\r\nFirst, a list of words in front of context in various docs, including synopses:\r\n\r\n- [x] sink\r\n- [x] number\r\n- [x] string\r\n- [ ] boolean\r\n- [ ] item (formerly \"scalar\", but still \"scalar\" in roast)\r\n- [ ] list\r\n- [ ] semilist\r\n- [ ] hash\r\n- [ ] quote (single and double)\r\n- [ ] rvalue\r\n- [ ] hyper\r\n- [ ] slurpy (same as \"eager\"?)\r\n- [ ] lazy\r\n- [ ] dereferencing\r\n- [ ] List of lists, \"lol\" context (Array constructor?)\r\n- [ ] declarational\r\n- [ ] enum\r\n\r\nSome other bugs this impacts, as I run across them:\r\n\r\n- [x] [RT 131008: lcm should not work with Nums, and maybe gcd too](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131008)\r\n- [x] [RT 131041: Use of Nil in string context](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131041)",
