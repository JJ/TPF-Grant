  "body": "Ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall#Passing_and_Returning_Values\r\n\r\nThe docs for passing Str with NativeCall say:\r\n> Note that a <b>null string</b> can be passed by passing the Str type object; a <b>null return</b> will also be represented by the type object.\"\r\n\r\nOn first reading I thought \"null string\" might mean an empty string.   Suggest using actual C jargon to make this unambiguous, e.g. \"a NULL string pointer\", \"a C NULL pointer\", or similar, to avoid confusion with a possibly-empty string which has an actual address.\r\n\r\nNote: In C, the symbol \"NULL\" (in upper case) is used to specify a null string pointer (or any kind of null pointer).  It is a macro defined by <stdlib.h> which expands to `0`, `(void *)0` or similar.\r\n",
