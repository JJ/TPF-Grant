Please note that very few buildin\r\n+functions and methods will detect infinite loops. It is the objective of the\r\n+user to L<handle|/type/Promise#method_in> timeouts.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few small nits:\r\n* change objective to responsibility\r\n* explain why the \"in\" method is helpful here.\r\n\r\nA bigger nit: this seems like the wrong section for this. Traps might be a better location. Also, which builtins work? are safe?\r\n\r\nThe current phrasing sounds like \"never use self referential structures\".\r\n\r\n",
