Again, this was something used sporadically and I had to choose what to follow. It is now more consistent.\r\n\r\nI have referred to C\\<List\\> meaning a class, rather than just 'a list'. Again, this seems more consistent to me with the rest of the document.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n    The template below contains optional suggestions.
