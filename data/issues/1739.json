  "body": "2. Difference between the 3rd and 4th example is simply grep's parentheses. In fact, they can be used on both, although you can't suppress them. We should either explain the difference or just eliminate it, because this is not the place to explain the difference between calling stuff with or without parentheses \r\n3. The next-to-last example results in `[people of earth Earth People]` in the way it is now, and  `[Earth People Earth People]` if we suppress the initial assignment (but keep `@result` from the previous assignments). It results in the right answer if it's zeroed or assigned to another variable.\r\n4. The syntax is so similar to the normal `. ` I should try and look for a real use case here. Right now it does not save typing, it kinda makes intent clearer, but then using \"reactive\" syntax is clear enough. \r\n5. Also, if you copy and paste the example, which is something people are wont to do, it will fail. Maybe instead of using comments we should just split the examples or else use different variables or whatever it takes to be copy-paste-runnable. \r\n\r\nI'll work on 3, but am open to suggestions on the rest. Except for the name. I like rocket. ",
