It is implemented and works in the current Rakudo release and I think I found that it is tested and passing in Perl6/Roast. When I first saw an example of it's use, I looked in docs.perl6.org/language/regexes and docs.perl6.org/language/grammars and could not find it. As someone on IRC said, searching for \"~\" is problematic. :-)\n",
