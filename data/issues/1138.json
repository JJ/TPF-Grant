  "body": "If you have `class c {method m {}}; role r is c {}` then role `r` can execute method `m` both through instantiation and autopunning with `.new` and through auto creation of a class (but not instance?) with `r.m()`\r\n\r\nThe language/objects page claim \"Roles cannot inherit from classes,\" under the inheritance subheading for roles seems confusing to me.  Watch out for a broken internal link in the index at the top of the page and try [https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Stubs](https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Stubs) to navigate just above the correct page section.\r\n\r\nSee IRC discussion: [https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-01-14#i_13920801](https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-01-14#i_13920801)\r\n\r\nBad link to \"#Inheritance\" seems to be issue #584",
