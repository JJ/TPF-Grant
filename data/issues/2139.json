  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe main problem with [this section](https://docs.perl6.org/language/list#index-entry-lazy_%28property_of_List%29) is nomenclature. Repeatedly this section refers to lazy *lists*, while most of the examples are actually lazy *arrays*. Anything which mixes in the `Iterable` role can be lazy, in fact, and that's not really well explained either. Also, it's indexed as Lazy (property of List), when it's actually a method of Iterable. `is-lazy` is a property of Iterator, not iterable, too. \r\n\r\nThere's also the error of referring to the role `Iterable` instead of the role [`Iterator`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Iterator#method_is-lazy), the one that actually implements all the lazy stuff., \r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nStop using the generic `list` and use specific denomination. Fix reference errors. ",
