  "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nMissing translation to German [issue 1984](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1984)\r\n\r\n## Solution provided\r\n\r\nTranslated README.md to German and provided README.de.md\r\n\r\nI left some words in English which I think are clearer than a translation into German (e.g. GitHub repository). If others who know the German-speaking Perl6 community better, please feel free to translate.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n- Is  it still appropriate to reference `rakudobrew` here? I thought this was not recommended anymore.\r\n- The whole section \"Building the HTML documentation\" seems a bit ackward in regards to dependencies. I think this should be cleaned up. May be worth a separate issue?\r\n- This leads to the question on how these translations are kept in sync with README.md",
