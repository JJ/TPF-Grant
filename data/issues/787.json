  "body": "At: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Int#routine_rand\n\nThe docs use the word \"between\" without clarifying the endpoint behavior. This should probably be made explicit. I went digging for the exact code, but ended up getting lost at the point that nqp doesn't actually reference where rand comes from. I'm assuming it's built into the behavior of Nums somewhere, but I was unable to find it immediately. My assumption would be that it's a real between 0 (inclusive) and n (non-inclusive).\n",
