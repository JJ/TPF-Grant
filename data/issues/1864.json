  "body": "ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#The_$_Variable\r\n\r\nThe fourth example in this section says\r\n> \"If you need to use the value of $ more than once in a scope, it should be copied to a new variable.\"\r\n\r\nbut the example code which follows doesn't actually show doing that (it shows `given ++$ { ... }` which is only a single usage.)\r\n\r\nAlso, _copying_ $ only allows reading the value more than once, not updating it.   A more general solution is to _bind_ another variable to $.  Then multiple reads & writes can be done.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Replace the above-quoted text and the example below it with the following:\r\n\r\n<i>If you need to reference the same $ variable more than once, bind another variable to it (in this example it would be more straightforward to just declare `state $x` and not use the magical `$` variable):</i>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nsub foo () {\r\n  my $x := $;\r\n  $x++;\r\n  say $x;\r\n  $x = $x + 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo() for ^3;\r\n# OUTPUT: «1␤3␤5␤»\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n(QUESTION: Is there a realistic use case for multiple-references to `$`?  That is, is there a case where `$` must be used instead of a regular `state $foo` and/or where the former is more clear and understandable?)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nRelatedly, the examples of using the `@` and `%` state variables use the phrase \"copy the value\" when actually a reference is being copied.  For beginners this may be confusing.  For example, at https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#The_@_Variable it says to \"copy the value\" like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nsub foo($x) {\r\n    my $v = @;\r\n    $v[$x] = $x;\r\n    say $v;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nBut the `$v = @` does not actually copy the array, but creates a scalar container containing a reference to the array, er, at least I think that's the correct language (see, it's confusing!)\r\n\r\nTo avoid irrelevant distractions, an example using an _explicit_ bind might be less confusing:\r\n<pre>\r\nsub foo($x) {\r\n    my @v := @;\r\n    @v[$x] = $x;\r\n    say @v;\r\n}\r\nfoo($_) for ^3;\r\n</pre>",
