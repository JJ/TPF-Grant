  "body": "The docs are currently vague on the use of sigils in constants.\n\nIn [5to6-nutshell](http://doc.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell#constant):\n\n> In Perl 6, constant is a declarator for variables, just like my, except the variable is permanently locked to the result of its initialization expression (evaluated at compile time).\n> \n> So, change the => to = , and add a sigil.\n\nBut [some](http://doc.perl6.org/language/terms#Identifier_terms) [examples](http://doc.perl6.org/language/syntax#Barewords_%28Constants%2C_Type_Names%29) do not actually use sigils, and in [Terms](http://doc.perl6.org/language/terms#Constants) this is explicit:\n\n> Constants are declared with constant and do not require a sigil. The RHS is evaluated at compile time, what may be too early to make sense.\n\nSo, regardless of whether they are _required_, I think the docs should at least be consistent in what they recommend, and this should probably be reflected in the examples.\n\nThoughts?\n",
