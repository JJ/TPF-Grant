  "body": "Ref: https://docs.perl6.org/language/containers#Binding\r\n\r\nThe doc says \"Sigilless variables also bind <b>by default</b> ...\", but doesn't hint at what <i>non</i>-default possibilities might be.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Show an example using a sigilless var does _not_ bind to something when created.\r\n\r\n(Added later) According to https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#Sigilless_variables \"sigilless variable do not have associated containers\", which makes me wonder how a sigilless variable could exist if it wasn't bound to something.  If the \"by default\" above is simply incorrect, then the doc might be changed to say \"Sigilless variables always bind, as do parameters with the trait is raw.\"   \r\n\r\nBut I still don't understand this: Both regular assignment `=` and bind `:=` operators can be used, e.g. `my \\x = $var;` and `my \\y = $var;` both compile and AFAICT do exactly the same thing.  But in that case, why doesn't Perl6 simply dis-allow normal assignment (`=`) on sigilless vars and avoid all confusion around this topic?    So if there _is_ some semantic difference, it would be helpful to describe or allude to what the difference is.",
