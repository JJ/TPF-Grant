  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThere are already a bunch of pages to help users experienced  in other languages learn Perl 6, but none for Node.js. The two languages share some common aspects, but many of them behave completely differently, e.g. promises and timeouts .\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nIf this should be written, I could write it, since Node.js is (sadly) the language I'm most experienced in. If anyone has any suggestions for language features that should be included, let me know.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n    The template below contains optional suggestions. If you cannot\r\n    provide some information, simply omit it.\r\n\r\n    Please state clearly in \"The problem\" whether you are reporting a\r\n    problem with the site (something does not show up in the search\r\n    drop-down menu or a page is missing, for instance), documentation\r\n    text or examples that are missing or should be improved or\r\n    something else. Describe clearly the problem and the page where\r\n    you found it.\r\n\r\n    If applicable, tell us in \"Suggestions\" what could be done to\r\n    solve the problem, such as \"Rephrase the description\" or \"Use an\r\n    example program that actually runs\".\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",
