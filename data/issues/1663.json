  "body": "I will try to integrate the docs of Grammar a week later or so. Because Grammar is the most attractive of Perl 6 to me now, but its doc is a little lack. What's worse, they are scattered in several pages.\r\n\r\nAt first I want to involve both Regex and Grammar, but it's too hard to make it in one pass.\r\n\r\nBelow are the pods considered to be integrated:\r\n`language/grammars` and `language/grammar_tutorial`, these two should be one.\r\n\r\nBesides `type/Grammar`, `type/Match` and `type/Cursor` may be involved. Because #1646 supposed what to document below `language` or `type`, the current text will be rearranged. Also I hope it be an example when filing document.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Grammar is one of the most awesome features supplied by rakudo/Perl 6. \r\n\r\nAny suggestion like what you want to be mentioned(such as `method make/made`) or how it's supposed to be organized is welcome. \r\nAny question/problem is welcome, too.",
