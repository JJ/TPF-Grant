  "body": "Currently this section states that:\r\n\r\n* All ranges (including non-lazy ones) will truncate the output/ omit undefined elements.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to split the section into two related but logically separate topics.\r\n\r\n1. If the element at index x does not exist then the result will be a Nil element (for Positionals).\r\n    * This behavior can be modified using the :v adverb. \r\n2. Using lazy Iterables as subscripts yields a different behavior. Only returns defined elements (given that the elements of the Iterable are not reified past the index of the first undefined element)\r\n    * Behind the scenes the elements of the lazy subscript are being reified up until the point that the element in the Positional is undefined.\r\n    * Continued use of lazy Lists will begin to return Nil elements as new elements in the lazy List are reified.\r\n    * Include justification for these behaviors. Sometimes returning undefined elements is desirable.\r\n        * DESIRABLE: assignment to their containers. eg @a[^10] = 1..10;\r\n        * NOT DESIRABLE: Running wild (if the following were to not truncate/end reification). eg. @a[1 .. *]\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttps://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-11-18#i_15466865",
