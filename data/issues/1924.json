  "body": "## Bug report\r\n\r\nIn [the documentation of the dot operators](https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#___top) it says in each and every one of them: \r\n\r\n>Technically, not a real operator; it's syntax special-cased in the compiler.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nSince they don't need to be in the same page, it might make sense, however, it makes even more sense to create a special page for that kind of syntax, maybe under the `/syntax` wing and link it from there. Another alternative is to use different phrasing for each one, although I don't like that one so much. \r\n\r\nThese repetitions appear also across pages, sometimes they are copy/pastes from the same initial one. Once again, create common page or rephrase so that they look different. ",
