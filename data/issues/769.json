  "body": "First of all, keep in mind that it is pretty much the start of our FAQ, so let's make it completely right.\n\n> Is there going to be a Perl 6 version 6.0.0?\n\nWhy would anybody ask this question? I think that this question can only be asked if it was not released yet, but it is. Maybe my non-native ear does not get it right, but I think the question itself should make it clear that we had a release. Something like “Why the first language release is called v6.c and not v6.0.0?”.\n\n> It was first implemented by the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler version 2015.12 and is **likely to be supported** by subsequent releases for the foreseeable future by use of the 'use 6.c' pragma**..**\n\nLikely to be supported? We had 7 releases after 2015.12, let's have some definite answer. I know that the situation with v6.c/v6.d is a bit unclear, but it does not mean that we cannot doc the current situation.\n\nAlso, two dots on the end.\n",
