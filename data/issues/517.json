  "body": "Rather than having a bunch of whackamole issues for each un-documented X:: class this is a placeholder for the documentation of the remaining undocumented exception sub-classes.\n\nThe exceptions should all be documented so that they can be linked from the documentation for the places that they might be thrown, as well as searchable for people who find they have an exception that they don't quite know where it comes from.\n\nIt is possible that some boilerplate for this could be generated automatically.\n\nThere are however a lot of exceptions so I have made #516 to discuss a better way of managing them so they don't swamp the rest of the type documentation.\n",
