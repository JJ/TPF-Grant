  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe [style guide](https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/writing-docs/STYLEGUIDE.md) suggests using `{}` for empty hashes and `%()` for non-empty hashes. This is inconsistent.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nSince `{}` is considered confusing (although technically it's supposed to be straight forward) with blocks, and empty `%()` is considered a trap (see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1946), why not just use `hash` instead? According to jnthn in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1946#issuecomment-399396270 these are a \"sure bet\".\r\n\r\nSuggested: avoid both `%()` (empty construct is a trap) and `{}` (possible confusion with blocks) for constructing hashes, and always use `hash` instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy $foo = hash;  # empty hash\r\nmy $bar = hash a => 'b', c => 'd';  # non-empty hash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: these can be used with or without parentheses. Since that goes for most expressions, that could probably use its own recommendation in the style guide.",
