  "body": "In Language/grammars.pod ws is defined at line 209 as one or more whitepace characters or a word boundary, i.e.` / \\s+ | <|w> / `\r\nIf, however, you define in a grammar, `token ws { \\s+ | <|w> }` , you may find that your previously working parser no longer parses.\r\nAfter looking in Language/regexes, I found there are some examples of redefining ws but no definition of how ws is defined by default. Those examples provided a clue that, perhaps ws is actually defined as, `token ws { <!ww> | \\s+ }`. Searching further, I found in stackoverflow a comment by moritz that ws is, in fact defined as `token ws { <!ww> | \\s+ }`. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47728466/perl-6-grammar-doesnt-match-like-i-think-it-should\r\nThe default definition of ws should be corrected in grammars.pod and added to the sigspace section of regexes.pod.\r\n\r\nOne other point that might be made clear is that a grammar that explicitly defines ws behaves a bit differently than one which uses the default definition. Using the default, ws gets thrown away. When ws is explicitly defined, whatever it parses gets put into the parse tree.",
