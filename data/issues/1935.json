Besides, `category: \"Reference\"` occurs unexpectedly and url form like `url: \" /language/regexes#index-entry-regex__%3C%7Cw%3E-regex__%3C%21%7Cw%3E-%3C%7Cw%3E_and_%3C%21%7Cw%3E%2C_word_boundary\"` make `L<>` refer ugly as well as incomprehensible\r\n\r\nsince htmlify.p6 was given to birth so long ago, I cannot understand a number of its design and logic, so can anybody please explain/talk about  how search logic in htmlify.p6 works? Maybe about `write-search-file()` and subroutines it calls.\r\n\r\nCo #1823 ",
