  "body": "## The problem\r\n\r\nThe way it is currently set up, the impression is given that The Docs are a different website than perl6.org.  Not having a prominent link to perl6.org is secluding unfamiliar guests from visiting perl6.org.  This choice is made even more obvious by how the banner currently just links to its self-same page.  So the \"real-estate\" is currently not being availed anyhow.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nI propose that only the \"homepage\" of docs.perl6 have the banner click-able to the homepage of perl6.org.  All the other pages of docs.perl6.org can remain the same, and remain linked to the homepage of Docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
