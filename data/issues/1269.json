  "body": "The docs for [Junction](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction) says\r\n\r\n> Junctions collapse into a single value in boolean context.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears they return another junction:\r\n\r\n\t> 4 > any( 2, 3 )\r\n\tany(True, True)\r\n\t> any( 2, 3 ) > 4\r\n\tany(False, False)\r\n\r\nYou might explain that by saying this isn't in boolean context yet and it does collapse:\r\n\r\n\t > ( any( 2, 3 ) > 4 ).so\r\n\t False\r\n\r\nBut, from the docs on `>`, I expected that the comparison operator itself would provide that already:\r\n\r\n> returns True if the first argument is larger than the second.\r\n\r\nAlthough not explicit, I take that to mean it evaluates to a Boolean, not a Junction. I don't particularly mind that it returns a Junction as long as its documented as such.\r\n\r\nI think that junctions should collapse into unique values  and asked about that in [perl6: Should junctions collapse unique values?](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131114).",
