  "body": "> **What is the Perl 6 spec?**\n> \n> The \"spec\" refers to the official test suite for Perl 6. It's called roast and hosted on github. It is the measure of how complete a Perl 6 implementation is.\n\nWell, my next question after reading this is “So is Rakudo complete? If not, how complete is it?”. And if we can't really say, then what kind of a measure is that?\n\nActually, “the measure of how complete a Perl 6 implementation is” sounds like some marketing blurb.\n\nWe have a much better description [in our glossary](https://docs.perl6.org/language/glossary#index-entry-roast), can we use it instead?\n",
