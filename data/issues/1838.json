  "body": "I noticed a [commit](https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/bc72bc3c5b826b79e830f7f22ed1779734818f73) fixed some links that are 404s and I clearly remembered using those links recently-ish, but I can't remember where exactly. It could've been a blog post, a response on social media, or an email. Regardless of what it was, those links are now broken due to some changes to our site.\r\n\r\nWe should be more mindful when changing links. If we're to fulfill the [Vision for the site](https://github.com/perl6/doc#vision), we can't continually break 3rd party communications and content (especially tutorials, blogs, videos, and books).\r\n\r\nThat point should be made in the contributing guide and some common forms of links should probably be tested (e.g. `/type/` and `/routine/` links). For example, https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proc$COLON$COLONAsync used to be a working link and I even remember [adding `.htaccess` rewrite rules](https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/3feecce1fd1671ab446a0faa6b9dd305ca23ea5b#diff-5537a4ed70cfb8fdbdad0926c6e51757) to keep that form working when we got rid of `$COLON` stuff in URLs. However, it appears [a more recent commit](https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/a9d617aad30e1699c93862fdc21525ae0643d700) to `.htaccess` broke those rewrites\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI ran a small Perl 6 one liner over the content of my 2-year old [blog](https://rakudo.party/) and these links turned up as broken:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#index-entry-nextsame-nextsame\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#index-entry-nextwith-nextwith\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#%3C%3C_and_%3E%3E_,_left_and_right_word_boundary\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/$\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/CONTROL\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/LEAVE\r\n- https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proc$COLON$COLONAsync\r\n\r\nThe pages for https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/CONTROL and https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/LEAVE now require [a space](https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/%20CONTROL) before the keyword so those two along with the `$COLON` stuff looks to me like accidental breakage of external links that should've been caught by something IMO.",
