We need some kind of a consensus.\n\nAlso, my thoughts from [this](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/752#issuecomment-238907993) comment:\n\n> I don't like NOTSPECCED issues floating there like this (especially that amount), so I have the following idea: we should tag stuff as NOTSPECCED, but if nothing can be done now, we can close the issue. Once something is implemented, we can reopen it.\n> In other words: if there is nothing we can do, then we consider the issue solved at this particular moment in time. This would clear the list of open issues, and the NOTSPECCED label will make it possible to check the list periodically to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks.\n",
