  "body": "I just bumped into this problem in thread: http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg03594.html but it is not over yet for my application. I still get the same error even after replacing the ```slurp-rest``` calls by plain ```slurp``` calls. There are other calls to ```open``` so I looked at https://docs.perl6.org/routine/open but as I can see nothing related to ```close``` is mentioned there. I think it would be better to mention when Perl closes the file automatically and when does it not.\r\n\r\nI also went over https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO$COLON$COLONHandle where ```close``` is described, but I think an explicit mention on how files are closed implicitly would be welcome.\r\n\r\n",
