  "body": "Since [the grant has started officially](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2018/02/grant-proposal-curating-and-im.html), one of the things I'd like to do is to have a clearer idea of what visitors do, where they come from, and where we lose them; I'd like to add Google Analytics code to the site and have it working for at least a month. In principle, I'd use my own code, but if there's some official Google account I could use, and whose results I can access, that would be fine.\r\nIn principle, I would remove it once I finish the grant, but I can leave it there if it helps, or change it to another one. \r\nAny ideas for/against?
